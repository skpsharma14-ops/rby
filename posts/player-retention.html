  <p>Ever wonder how we make our games? It's a mix of drawing, coding, and lots of testing to make sure everything is super fun for you!</p>
  <h2>Step 1: The Idea</h2>
  <p>It all starts with a fun idea! We think about what kind of race would be the most exciting. A race through a forest? A race in the city? We choose the best ideas to build.</p>
  <h2>Step 2: Drawing the Fun</h2>
  <p>Next, we draw everything! We design cool cars with bright colors and fun tracks with interesting things to see. We want our games to look happy and exciting.</p>
  <h2>Step 3: Writing the Code</h2>
  <p>This is where we tell the computer how the game works. We write simple code to make the car move when you press the buttons and to keep track of your score. We work hard to make sure the game runs smoothly on any device.</p>
  <h2>Step 4: Testing, Testing, Testing!</h2>
  <p>Before we share the game with you, we play it a lot! We make sure it's not too hard or too easy. We fix any bugs to make sure it's a perfect experience for our players.</p>
  <p>We love making games for you to enjoy, and we hope you have as much fun playing them as we do making them!</p>
